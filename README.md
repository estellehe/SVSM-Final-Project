# SVSM-Final-Project
Final project at Summer Ventures in Science and Mathematics: The Development of Interactive Parachute Design Simulations and Extensions

Two MATLAB-based simulations, Designer Panel and Parachute Simulation, and two Python-based extensions, Rocket Extension and Skydivers Extension, were built to model the falling process of objects with Parachutes and help users with different needs, including parachute designers, model rocket builders, skydivers, etc. to calculate values of some crucial elements in falling.
